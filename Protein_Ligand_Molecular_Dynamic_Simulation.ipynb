        "This tutorial is based on the \"Making it Rain paper and Jupyter notebook, developed by Pablo R. Arantes, Marcelo D. Polêto, Conrado Pedebos, and Rodrigo Ligabue-Braun\" (https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Making-it-Rain%3A-Cloud-Based-Molecular-Simulations-Arantes-Pol%C3%AAto/8a92263599842e5be1e7d730e7c058a1ed9a76c4 ). This pipeline is designed to show how cloud-based molecular simulations can be run efficiently and affordably. I highly recommend reading the paper before jumping into the code for a deeper understanding of the methodology.\n",

        "\n",
        "Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is a computational method used to study the physical movements of atoms and molecules over time. Essentially, it allows us to simulate how molecules interact, move, and change over a period of time under certain conditions, based on the laws of classical mechanics. MD simulations are especially useful in fields like chemistry, biophysics, and drug design to study the behavior of molecules at the atomic level."

        "*   MD simulations model the interactions between atoms or molecules by solving Newton’s equations of motion.\n",
        "*   The key goal is to simulate how the system evolves with time by calculating the forces acting on each atom and updating their positions accordingly.\n",
        "*   Each atom is treated as a point mass with a certain charge, and the forces between them are based on force fields, which are mathematical descriptions of interatomic interactions.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   Force Fields: The interactions between atoms are governed by force fields, List item which define how atoms \"feel\" each other and interact. Common force fields used in MD simulations are AMBER, CHARMM, and GROMOS, each with different strengths for specific types of molecules (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, etc.).\n",
        "*   Newton's Equations of Motion: The simulation uses Newton's second law (F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration) to compute how the atoms move over time. These calculations are done step by step, usually at femtosecond (10^-15 s) time intervals.\n",
        "*   Time Evolution: The simulation \"moves\" the atoms by small amounts based on the forces, and after many steps, the system's behavior can be observed, such as protein folding, ligand binding, or the diffusion of molecules in solution."

        "*   Production Run: After equilibration, the system runs for a longer period, and data is collected to observe the molecular interactions over time.\n",
        "*   Analysis: After the simulation, you analyze the results, which could include tracking the movement of specific atoms, calculating properties like RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation), RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation), or protein-ligand interactions, or visualizing molecular dynamics."
